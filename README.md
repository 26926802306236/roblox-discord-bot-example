- The Cookie variable should be your roblox users cookie | On google on roblox.com in incognito mode press Ctrl + Shift + I on your bot account then go to cookies, press on cookies, then look for www.roblox.com under cookies, then press it, then locate .ROBLOXSECURITY, go copy that. (May change 1-2 days (As long as you ran it once it will work.))

- The GroupId variable should be your roblox groups id | On roblox.com go to your group then go up to your searchbar then you should see roblox.com/ some numbers, copy those numbers, thats your GroupId.

- The MaxRank variable should be the maximum rank you want the bot to be able to rank someone.

- The MinRank variable should be the minimum rank you want the bot to be able to rank someone.

- The Prefix variable should be your (prefix)rank command in discord. Ex: +rank, !rank, ~rank

- The Token variable should be your discord bots token, to make a bot go to https://discord.com/developers then locate New Bot after logging in, fill out the name (It wont be your actual bot name) then press create. After that go to the program then press bot, then press Add Bot. After that you can choose its username. Then under Token press copy token, this will be your bots token.
